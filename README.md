**Score Counter Web App**

This project is a basic score counter web application designed for tracking scores in games or other activities. It's built entirely with client-side technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for simplicity and ease of deployment.

**Features**:
1. **Add/Remove Players**: Easily add new players and remove existing ones.
2. **Score Tracking**: Increment, decrement, and reset scores for each player.
3. **Player Editing**: Edit player names, increment values, and reset values.
4. **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing.
5. **Local Storage**: Player data is persisted in the browser's local storage, so scores are saved between sessions.

**Technologies Used**:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

**Future Enhancements**:
1. **Leaderboard**: Displays a ranked leaderboard of players based on their scores.
2. **Visual Top Player Indication**: Visual display of the top player(s).
